# hacspec

hacspec is a proposal for a new specification language for crypt primitives that is succinct, that is easy to read and implement, and that lends itself to formal verification. hacspec aims to formalize the pseudocode used in crypto standards by proposing a formal syntax that can be checked for simple errors. hacspec specifications can be compiled to coq, F*, easycrypt, and hence can be used as the basis for formal proofs of functional correctness, cryptographic security, and side-channel resistance.
